To Check your current Java version on your Windows OS open a Command Prompt and type

## Restoring Data

Your data is stored within the lib folder. This folder should always be located in the directory of the .jar file.
The file is verified on launch to keep everything running well. If your lib folder (or content within), is not found, the files will be restored.
When your files fail to verify and are restored, your data is set to default (only applied for missing files). This means your passwords will no longer show.

Moving your .jar file to a directory outside of your lib folder will NOT remove the original lib folder. Moving the file back will show your orginal data again.
